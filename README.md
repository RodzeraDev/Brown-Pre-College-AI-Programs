# Brown Pre-College AI Programs

This repo has many AI projects created during my time in the Brown University Pre-College Program, specifically the course titled "Using AI to make AI".

Each project in this repo is self-contained, focused, and rooted in core AI concepts like neural networks, classification, training models, and evaluating performance. Some are simple, single-file experiments. Others begin to explore more advanced ideas that connect to real-world machine learning.

### Why this matters

These projects were created under the complex and structured Brown course, designed to introduce high school students to university-level AI thinking. Brown College, which is one of the eight Ivy League institutions, brings a unique approach to computer science education: intellectually rigorous, deeply creative, and open-ended.

This program challenged me not only to understand how AI works, but to start thinking like someone who builds it.
