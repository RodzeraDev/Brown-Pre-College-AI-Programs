

This project is a sentiment classification model trained on the IMDB movie reviews dataset. It analyzes text to predict whether a movie review is **positive** or **negative**, reaching an accuracy of **86.75%** after just **5 epochs**.

**About the Project**
This model is an application of natural language processing (NLP) for real-world sentiment analysis, all only using IMDB database

The training process involves:
- Preprocessing the IMDB dataset for binary classification.
- Tokenizing text and applying sequence padding.
- Training a neural network using **Keras** and TensorFlow.
- Achieving strong validation performance in only a few training cycles.
